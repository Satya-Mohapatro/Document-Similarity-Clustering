## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project **clusters documents based on their semantic similarity** using **Hierarchical Clustering** with a **clean ML pipeline**:

âœ… Text cleaning and lemmatization using **spaCy**  
âœ… TF-IDF vectorization and dimensionality reduction using **Truncated SVD**  
âœ… **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering** with visualization  
âœ… **Silhouette Score** evaluation  
âœ… **Deployed on Streamlit** for interactive exploration

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Portfolio** to demonstrate **end-to-end pipeline structuring, unsupervised learning, and practical deployment**.
